A print assembly (102) ejects print                liquid onto selected portions of build material on                a build platform of the 3D printer to form a 3D                object from the build material. A liquid cartridge                receiver (108) holds a removable liquid cartridge                to make available print liquid from the liquid                cartridge for the print assembly. A delivery system                provides print liquid to the print assembly.    USE - Three-dimensional (3D) printer for producing                3D objects including aerospace components, machine                components, medical devices e.g. implants,                automobile components, fashion products, structural                and conductive metals, ceramics, and other                applications.    ADVANTAGE - The closed-loop material handling can reduce                the risk of unknown material entering the 3D                printer. The recycle cartridges filled with recycle                material can be removed and kept for future use                when the 3D printer is short of recycle material to                be mixed with new material and utilized or consumed                during printing. The 3D-printed-object recovery                zone can also include containers to store printed                3D objects, a light source to illuminate the zone,                and devices to provide air flow to prevent or                reduce excess build material from exiting the 3D                printer during recovery of the printed 3D                object.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method                of operating a three-dimensional (3D)                printer.

The upper part of the silo is provided                with a first powder inlet (21), and the bottom end                is provided with a first powder outlet (22). The                first powder inlet is connected to the 3D printer                cabin. A powder storage tank (45) is located                directly below the filling device and is connected                with the filling device. The top part of the tank                is provided with a second powder inlet (41), and                the bottom end is provided with a second powder                outlet (42). A fan (6) is connected with the top                part of the filter via a suction pipe, and used to                continuously suck the gas in the silo via the                filter until a negative pressure is formed in the                silo. After the negative pressure is formed, a part                of the powder in the lower silo flows from the                first powder inlet to the first powder outlet, and                a part flows upward into the filter.    USE - 3D printing powder recycling system for                recycling the residual 3D printing powder in a                printer cabin.    ADVANTAGE - The fan is arranged to continuously suck the                gas in the feed bin through the air suction pipe by                the filter, so that negative pressure is formed in                the feed bin. The 3D printing powder in the 3D                printer bin is sucked by the negative pressure and                falls into the powder storage tank. The automatic                recovery of the 3D printing powder remained in the                3D printer bin is realized, and the oxidation of                the 3D printing powder caused by the contact with                air in the recovery process is effectively                prevented. The filter and the back-blowing air bag                on the filter are arranged to back-blow the 3D                printing powder adsorbed in the filter into the                blanking bin and finally into the powder storage                tank, so that no powder residue is left in the                device, and the powder recycling efficiency is                improved. The automatic powder recycling is                realized through a simple structure, the use is                convenient, the recycling efficiency and the safety                are improved, and the production and use                requirements are met.

ADVANTAGE - The method enables realizing recycling of                partial resin matrix, thus improving recycling                benefit of waste continuous fiber reinforced                thermoplastic 3D printing composite material, and                improving recycling efficiency, and hence improving                economic benefit of the material. The method allows                the molten resin matrix material to be dropped into                the material receiving groove under the action of                gravity, thus preventing the resin matrix from                accumulating on the surface of the composite                material to recover to gradually increase the                thickness of the resin base unit, so that power of                the heating head can be kept stable, thus avoiding                increase of energy consumption, and avoiding                affecting the peeling efficiency of the                fiber.

The bulk material                volume is formed such that the top portion is                smaller than the base portion. The layer-by-layer                technique used in forming the bulk material volume                is performed using a 3D printing device which has a                layer applying unit (3), a support (4), and a layer                bonding unit (5). The layer applying unit deposits                the material layers parallel to the support. The                support is arranged to receive the material layers.

ADVANTAGE - Provides an additive manufacturing method that                is cost and time efficient, and ensures reduced                amount of material needed to be prepared for 3D                printing. Saves energy, costs and manufacturing                time due to reduced amount of required particulate                material. Reduces wear of the particulate material                which, after the 3D printing has finished, is                recycled to a storage chamber for preparation for                the next run. Ensures reduced required total                building time since reduced number of repetitions                is required and less abundant material needs to be                removed to release the printed 3D products. Removes                the need for filling the whole void defined by the                container, thus saving material and reducing the                wear of particulate material which may be recycled                back for a second run after the 3D printing is                completed.

A modeling                material recycling part (700) is connected to the                modeling material collecting part to filter the                collected modeling material to resupply the                filtered modeling material to the modeling material                circulating part.    USE - Three-dimensional (3D) printing apparatus for                building 3D objects for domestic, educational and                medical applications.    ADVANTAGE - The apparatus is designed such that a light                source unit is arranged inside the modeling                material circulating part instead of outside of the                modeling material circulating part, so that the                apparatus can be reduced in volume by a space that                is occupied by the light source unit when compared                to a case in which the light source unit is placed                outside the modeling material circulating part. The                apparatus allows a collection blade to improve                efficiency in which the modeling material is                separated from a circulation belt. The apparatus                reduces the modeling material consumed when a model                is modeled to significantly reduce cost required                according to purchase of the modeling                material.

 MURPHY K N	LACAZE A D (LACA-Individual);  MURPHY K N (MURP-Individual);  ROBOTIC RES LLC (ROBO-Non-standard)	201529786N	   NOVELTY - The method involves providing a 3D printer.                Several additional nozzles emit chemicals onto or                around a printed portion while still in the                printing chamber. The nozzles emit a foam compound                to fill cavities in the printed portion as it is                being printed. The nozzles emit a dye coloring into                the plastic or the foam as it is being printed or                filled. The nozzles emit a disinfectant or                antibacterial compound to sterilize printed                portions.    USE - Method for multi-stage three dimensional (3D)                printing, for rapid prototyping using 3D printers                where printing is combined with other features such                as insulation, sterilization, and embedding.    ADVANTAGE - The apparatus and method are provided for                multi-component devices for providing a second                dispensing nozzle for filling cavities with other                compounds such as foam, sterilizing portions, and                embedding portions or additional elements within                the printing layers for additional strength and                changing mold properties of a final product.

USE - Method for manufacturing 3D printed post used                CMWRTPC for use in the automotive, aerospace, or                construction industries.    ADVANTAGE - The brass wire as CMW is derived from                post-used or recycled sources, promoting                sustainability and resource efficiency. By                incorporating continuous brass wire into the PLA                matrix, the resulting 3D printed composite exhibits                enhanced mechanical properties compared to neat                PLA. The composite showed improvements of 32.9% in                Young's modulus and 22.7% 35 in tensile strength.                Additionally, with a 3.2 vol.% CMW loading, the                composite demonstrated a 24.4% increase in flexural                modulus, a 40.8% increase in flexural strength, a                72% increase in maximum flexural load-bearing                capacity, and a 50.3% increase in work of fracture.                The ability to vary the volume percentage of CMW in                the PLA matrix allows for the customization of                mechanical properties to meet specific application                requirements. This flexibility enables the                optimization of the composite's performance for                high-load-bearing applications. The use of recycled                or post-used brass wire as reinforcement promotes                sustainability and resource efficiency, reduces the                environmental impact of the manufacturing process.                Additionally, the use of recycled materials can                potentially lower the overall cost of the composite                material, making it more economically viable for                various applications. The method leverages the                advantages of 3D printing technology, specifically                the material extrusion (MEX) technique. This                additive manufacturing method enables the                fabrication of complex geometries and customized                designs that would be challenging or impossible to                produce using traditional manufacturing                processes.

A reflector                (122) is associated with the thermic source to                reflect upward-emitted light rays in a downward                direction toward the target zone. An absorber (124)                is positioned above the thermic source to absorb                light rays that reflect off of the target zone. The                absorber is also positioned along a first portion                of a side wall of the fusing module. A second                portion of the side wall comprises a side wall                reflector (125) to reflect light rays from the                thermic source toward the target zone.    USE - Fusing module for use in three dimensional                (3D) printing system e.g. 3D printer.    ADVANTAGE - By absorbing the reflected light, the fusing                module reduces the effect of the back reflections                including the irradiance variations. The reduction                in irradiance variation helps to improve                dimensional consistency of portions, reduces the                variations in the material properties of portions,                improves the cosmetic appearance of portions and                enables a higher portion packing density within the                build area of a 3D printing device which reduces                portion costs. The absorber effectively terminates                and prevents the reflected rays from returning to                or recycling back to the build material.

A leveling module (130) is movably arranged in the tank. A curing module (140) is arranged above the tank. The curing module has a light source and a focusing assembly fixed above the tank. A control module (150) is electrically connected to the injecting module, leveling module and the curing module. The movement of leveling module in the tank is regulated by the control module so as to level the surface of photosensitive resin material in the tank. The excess photosensitive resin material is driven to a recycle zone of the tank by the leveling module. The curing module is controlled to cure the leveled photosensitive resin material to form a solidification layer. The viscosity of photosensitive resin material is larger than or equal to 1000 centipoises.    USE - Three dimensional (3D) printing apparatus for the construction of 3D models.    ADVANTAGE - The quality of solidification layer is improved by the leveling module. The performance of 3D printing is improved by saving the waiting time required for curing the photosensitive resin material even when the viscosity of photosensitive resin material is high. The structure and strength of 3D object are improved due to the improvement of flatness of photosensitive resin material after the curing operation. The production of 3D printing apparatus is improved by allowing the user to remove a carrier from the tank to obtain the required 3D object without disassembling the whole tank. The injecting and leveling operations are performed efficiently by performing the injecting and leveling operations simultaneously.

Two shielding ring plates are                symmetrically fixed on the lower end surface of                incubator. The screw is coaxially fixed on the                output shaft of lifting motor. The lifting motor is                fixedly arranged on side wall of the mounting                plate. Four symmetrical spray wheels are rotatably                arranged on the inner side wall of incubator. A                spraying belt is sheathed on the outside of                spraying wheel. The vertical pulley is rotated and                arranged at the center of the upper end of mounting                plate. The spray gear is drivingly connected to the                outer wall of one end of stepping rod. The sliding                rod is made of anti-friction materials. The front                end of the heat preservation box is rotatably                provided with a glass door.    USE - Laser heat recovery and reuse method for dual                laser printing of three-dimensional (3D) printing                device such as laser printer.    ADVANTAGE - The method drives the shear shaft to slide                back and forth in the shear arc hole by the                recovery motor, thus completing the rotation of the                flap with the circulating fan in the equipment. The                circulating fan is rotated to recover the                high-temperature printing powder from the printing                radiation, and the collected high-temperature                powder is transported to the sprayer again through                the steel pipe on the side wall of the collection                hopper and the connecting hose. The bevel gear set                drives the sprayer to move to spray the                high-temperature printing powder, so as to complete                the recycling and reuse of the printing powder that                is not printed by the heat in the laser printing.                The temperature transfer cycle in the device is                completed, thus avoiding that the incubator needs                to be heated by an external heater multiple times                for heat preservation, which causes the phenomenon                of wasting heat in laser printing.

The                first build material and the second build material                are mixed according to a mixing ratio. A processor                (105,110) is used to determine the mixing ratio                based on inputs indicating print job                characteristics and material constraints (122). A                storage (120) is used to store material constraints                relating to the build material. The storage stores                upper and lower threshold values for the material                mixture for a build material. An interface is used                to obtain material availability data and the                processor uses material availability (126) as a                further input.    USE - Apparatus for controlling supply of material                for use in build unit of three-dimensional (3D)                printer.    ADVANTAGE - The adjustment is made for accuracy or                thoroughness of the recovery of powder and further                deducted from the total powder volume for the 3D                print job to provide a more accurate estimate. The                mixing ratio optimization instructions seeks to                minimize the volume of fresh material used whilst                staying within the limitations of the material                constraints. The apparatus ensures print job                quality whilst also reducing the total cost to the                user. The processor includes constraints based upon                the material availability and estimates derived in                blocks to ensure that the recycled material remains                between the minimum and maximum thresholds, when                optimizing the mix ratio. The optimized mix ratio                provided by the apparatus reduces the usage of one                of the build materials.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the                following:    (1) a method for controlling supply of                material for use in build unit of three-dimensional                (3D) printer; and    (2) a machine readable storage medium storing                program for controlling supply of material for use                in build unit of three-dimensional (3D)                printer.

The                convolution is performed at a first length scale to                produce the quantification. A second convolution is                performed at a second length scale to produce a                second quantification, and a third convolution is                performed at a third length scale to produce a                third quantification. The first length scale, the                second length scale, and the third length scale are                unequal. The manufacturing powder degradation is                predicted based on the second quantification and                the third quantification. The position comprises an                X location, a Y location, and a Z location, and the                manufacturing powder degradation is predicted based                on a build height.    USE - Method for predicting powder degradation in                computing device (claimed) such as three                dimensional (3D) printer, personal computer, server                computer, smartphone and tablet computer.    ADVANTAGE - The recycling of the powder reduces waste and                reduces the cost of printing each object. The                method allows accurately determining manufacturing                powder degradation in a relatively short time                period. The machine learning model predicts the                manufacturing powder degradation based on the                quantification and the position of the voxel. The                degree of degradation may be estimated by                predicting a post-print quality metric for the                powder at a voxel or voxels and/or by specifying a                change in the quality metric projected to result                from printing. The method provides enhanced control                over the quality of recycled powder and cost to                maintain that quality.

An                extraction plate (20) is mounted within tank to                which an object (22) is formed from cured portions                are affixed. A height adjustor is configured to                control a vertical position of extraction plate. A                controller is configured to operate height adjustor                so as to adjust a displacement from a first surface                during printing of object. A resin circulatory                system (30) is configured to pump a first volume of                the photo-curing liquid resin out of the tank                through sidewall openings and into a reservoir and                to pump a second volume of the photo-curing liquid                resin into the tank from the reservoir under                control of the controller.    USE - Additive manufacturing apparatus for                three-dimensional (3D) printing system for forming                objects through photo-curing of liquid resin in                tank by selective exposure to radiation during                printing operation.    ADVANTAGE - The photo-curing liquid resin is recycled in                the fashion to manage the temperature of the liquid                resin in the tank. The controller is configured to                operate the height adjustor so as to adjust the                vertical displacement of the extraction plate                during printing of the object. The system is                provided for reducing or eliminating side effects                of localized heating by displacing the resin                relative to build area for the object. The thermal                imaging device provides feedback concerning                temperatures experienced in the build area, thus,                allowing control over the pumping arrangement to                control the rate at which resin is circulated                through the build area.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method                for forming objects through photo-curing of liquid                resin in tank by selective exposure to radiation                during printing operation.    DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a schematic cross-section                view of a 3D printing system.    10Tank    11Bottom opening    14Flexible membrane    18Photo-curing liquid polymer    20Extraction plate    22Object    25Mask    26Light source    30Resin circulatory system 			A32 (Polymer fabrication - such as moulding, extrusion, forming, laminating, spinning.);  A85 (Electrical applications.);  X25 (Industrial Electric Equipment)	A09-D03;  A11-B16;  A11-C02B;  X25-A08A;  X25-A08B;  X25-A08M2	B29C-064/135;  B29C-064/286;  B29C-064/357;  B29C-064/393;  B33Y-010/00;  B33Y-030/00;  B33Y-040/00;  B33Y-050/02;  B29C-064/129;  B29C-064/30;  B29C-035/16;  B29C-064/232;  B29C-064/245;  B29C-064/264;  B29C-064/295;  B29C-064/321;  B29C-064/236;  B29C-064/314;  B29C-064/364;  B29C-064/20;  B29C-064/255;  B29C-064/25;  B33Y-070/00	US2020055251-A1   20 Feb 2020   B29C-064/357   202017Pages: 17   English;  WO2020040976-A1   27 Feb 2020   B29C-064/129   202018   English;  AU2019326296-A1   11 Mar 2021   B29C-064/129   202122   English;  CA3110067-A1   27 Feb 2020   B29C-064/129   202122   English;  KR2021044263-A   22 Apr 2021   B29C-064/129   202134   ;  CN112888551-A   01 Jun 2021   B29C-064/129   202148   Chinese;  EP3840936-A1   30 Jun 2021   B29C-064/129   202156   English;  JP2021534021-W   09 Dec 2021   B29C-064/314   202100Pages: 21   Japanese;  US11203156-B2   21 Dec 2021   B29C-064/357   202104   English;  CN112888551-B   21 Feb 2023   B29C-064/20   202317   Chinese;  EP3840936-B1   03 May 2023   B29C-064/129   202336   English;  IL280939-A   29 Apr 2021   B29C-064/129   202346   English;  JP7500078-B2   17 Jun 2024   B29C-064/393   202452   Japanese;  IL280939-B   01 Jan 2024   B29C-064/129   202497   English	US2020055251-A1    US105307    20 Aug 2018;   WO2020040976-A1    WOUS045214    06 Aug 2019;   AU2019326296-A1    AU326296    06 Aug 2019;   CA3110067-A1    CA3110067    06 Aug 2019;   KR2021044263-A    KR707557    06 Aug 2019;   CN112888551-A    CN80069128    06 Aug 2019;   EP3840936-A1    EP761991    06 Aug 2019;   JP2021534021-W    JP510027    06 Aug 2019;   US11203156-B2    US105307    20 Aug 2018;   CN112888551-B    CN80069128    06 Aug 2019;   EP3840936-B1    EP761991    06 Aug 2019;   IL280939-A    IL280939    06 Aug 2019;   JP7500078-B2    JP510027    06 Aug 2019;   IL280939-B    IL280939    06 Aug 2019	AU2019326296-A1 PCT application Application WOUS045214;   AU2019326296-A1 Based on Patent WO2020040976;   CA3110067-A1 PCT application Application WOUS045214;   CA3110067-A1 Based on Patent WO2020040976;   KR2021044263-A PCT application Application WOUS045214;   KR2021044263-A Based on Patent WO2020040976;   CN112888551-A PCT application Application WOUS045214;   CN112888551-A Based on Patent WO2020040976;   EP3840936-A1 PCT application Application WOUS045214;   EP3840936-A1 Based on Patent WO2020040976;   JP2021534021-W PCT application Application WOUS045214;   JP2021534021-W Based on Patent WO2020040976;   US11203156-B2 Previous Publ.

USE - A three-dimensional print head                apparatus.    ADVANTAGE - The print head mechanism in combination with                robotic arm minimizes launch mass of construction                materials and reduces human involvement with                construction activities. The sealable aperture may                be sealed, or closed, to retain print media within                the cavity of the hopper and prevent print media                from entering or exiting the upper aperture of the                hopper. The use of polymer concrete material                provides a beneficial advantage to off Earth and                remote on Earth construction projects because it                may be used with local granular material, or dirt,                and recycled plastics.

The build table is movable                without contacting the fixed structure, and a gap                between the build table and the fixed structure                varies as the build table moves along the first                axis.    USE - The processing machine is useful for building                a portion; and for powder containment in 3D metal                print system (all claimed).    ADVANTAGE - An advantage of processing machine that has no                walls or pre-fabricated powder-containment                structure configured to surround or to contain                portion being built, is the elimination of a high                temperature seal between the build table and walls                of the processing machine. The containment                structure reduces the loss of unused powder by                containing portion of the unused powder in the                powder bed, so that the contained unused powder                does not become lost or dispersed. It facilitates                moving (e.g. robotically) the portion to an                annealing area after fabrication, thus freeing                processing machine for the next build, without                breaking a vacuum environment around the portion.                It also reduces clean up by reducing dispersal of                unused powder. The method reduces waste of the                powder used to build the portion, facilitates clean                up and recycling of the powder, improves the                productivity of portion fabrication, and improves                usability through automatic generation and editing                of the geometry of the containment structure.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for:    powder containment in a three-dimensional (3D)                metal print system which involves building a                containment structure (28) configured to contain a                powder and a metal portion being built from the                powder by the 3D print system while the metal                portion is being built, where walls of the                containment structure are built from the powder by                the 3D print system atop a build table during                portion fabrication;    building a portion using a processing machine,                which involves distributing powder onto a build                table using a powder supply assembly to form a                powder layer; and directing an energy beam at a                portion of the powder on the build table using an                energy system to form a portion of the portion and                to form a portion of a containment structure to                contain the portion while the portion is being                built by the processing machine; and    a 3D metal print system for building a metal                portion.

The planarizing region is                printed with the additive manufacturing system                based on the generated digital model of the                planarizing region. The printed planarizing region                has a planar top surface in a build plane, and a                bottom surface that mirrors the mapped topography.                The three-dimensional region (30) is printed over                the-planar top surface of the printed planarizing                region.    USE - Method for printing three-dimensional region                and support structure.    ADVANTAGE - The printed material achieves good adhesive                bonding to the platen surface. The planar top                surface of the planarizing region accordingly                allows subsequent regions and support structures to                be printed with high resolutions, while allowing                the platen to be manufactured and installed with                reasonable tolerances. The time required to measure                platen surface as well as time and material                requirements during the printing operation are                reduced.
